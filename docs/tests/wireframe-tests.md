## 3. Observations / Feedback

### Task 1: Add a new race

- **User A:** Understood immediately, navigation was simple.
- **User B:** Understood and was simple but think another icon for help should be like a ? or something.
- **User C:** Found it intuitive but wanted confirmation after creation.

### Task 2: Admin approves a race

- **User A** Easy, simple with both colors and icons.
- **User B** It was good and easy to navigate.
- **User C** Was a little confused at the start to find what navigation button to press but find out quickly.

### Task 3: Change a user to admin

- **User A** Liked that it will be a popup when the change is done, because in the test it was a little hard to understans if the change went thru or not.
- **User B** Find out easly.
- **User C** Did it all right and thought it was easy to find and do.

### Task 4: Add a race to the bucket list

- **User A** No issues, function was clear and intuitive.
- **User B** Card should have a description and everything should be like a list and not on the side.
- **User C** No problems, was good and easy.

## 4. Summary & Recommendations

- **Positive:**
  - Users generally found the wireframe intuitive, especially for adding races to the bucket list.
  - Admin tasks, such as approving a race and changing user roles, were mostly clear once users located the correct buttons.
  - Visual cues like colors and icons helped users navigate the admin tasks efficiently.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**
  - **Add a new race:** Consider change the help icon to guide less experienced users.
  - **Change a user to admin:** Ensure there is a clear confirmation message or popup after the change to remove uncertainty.
  - **Add a race to the bucket list:** Include descriptions or a more structured list format to make it clearer for some users (race cards).
