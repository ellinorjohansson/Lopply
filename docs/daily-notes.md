- Today i installed Nextjs using the standard installation by Nextjs. Also installed Prettier and made it work with eslint and connected it to github repo. Went well.
- Next time i will add develop branch and connect working branch to develop so main keeps clean and safe. Then i will continue with the todo list.

- Today i added a readme structure and added things that i can add at this time like tech stack and summery of project.
- I also moved around in project beacuse i relized that i want a todo folder for next thing to do. I also moved the auth and database related things to the first sprint because i relized that would be nice to get done now in the beginning.

- Today i added common.json for reusble text. Open up for adding more language like swedish, but started with only english. Went well and next thing todo is to install auth.js.

**2025-12-22**

- Installed basic auth.js. I just followed thru the docs of the installation. (not connected to login/signup or mongodb yet)
- Deploy to Vercel (deployed but db dont show)
- Added tailwind config and fixed with font, colors and icons. Struggled a lot with tailwind but now it works (don't really know if its truly the right way to do it tho)
- Added the header and fixed so the tailwind classes for color works properly because it didnt work like it should before. The thing was that i use tailwind v4 and there for i need to use @theme and not :root. So that was why it didnt work. Took a lot of time to figure it out but hopfully this works (it does but i hope it stays this way)

* Next thing todo is to fix vercel deploy, becuse now the data from mongodb dosent show.

- Fixed the hover bg in the menu, font size, bugs and small style changes. So now the menu works like it should and i can do a pr.
- Started with the footer, added the coponent to the layout structure and started with adding some information in footer.

- Done with the footer. Added style and things that was left to do with it like "all right reserved" thing. Also did style for mobile footer so it looks good on every device.
