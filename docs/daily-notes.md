- Today i installed Nextjs using the standard installation by Nextjs. Also installed Prettier and made it work with eslint and connected it to github repo. Went well.
- Next time i will add develop branch and connect working branch to develop so main keeps clean and safe. Then i will continue with the todo list.

- Today i added a readme structure and added things that i can add at this time like tech stack and summery of project.
- I also moved around in project beacuse i relized that i want a todo folder for next thing to do. I also moved the auth and database related things to the first sprint because i relized that would be nice to get done now in the beginning.

- Installed basic auth.js. I just followed thru the docs of the installation. (not connected to login/signup or mongodb yet)
- Deploy to Vercel (deployed but db dont show)
- Added tailwind config and fixed with font, colors and icons. Struggled a lot with tailwind but now it works (don't really know if its truly the right way to do it tho)
